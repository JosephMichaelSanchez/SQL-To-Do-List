# weekend-sql-to-do-list

## Weekend Challenge

### Description
The Taskmaster 5000 allows users to create a list of tasks, and save them to a database. Once a task is added, it is marked 'incomplete' and is color-coded red. Once a task is complete, the user can click the 'Mark Complete' button. The task will then be marked 'complete' and it's color will change from red to green. At any time, a user can choose to delete a task from their list, and it will be deleted from the database.
